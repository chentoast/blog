I'm currently a junior at Boston College, studying psychology, math and computer science, and I'm blogging about my learning process through the fields of statistics and machine learning.  Since I believe that the best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else, its my hope that writing about these topics will help me gain a more complete understanding of them, since the majority of my knowledge is self taught.  In addition, starting this blog will hopefully motivate me to learn more (I have a terrible habit of starting things and leaving them halfway through).

As such, this blog is mainly for my sake, although I hope I didn't discourage you from reading further.  Most of the posts will be shamelessly ripped from some other resource, and so I'll include references whenever possible.

With all that said, lets get started!  I should also note that the aesthetics of this blog was influenced heavily by Dustin Tran's blog and NIPS formatting, with the style of the posts borrowing from Larry Wasserman's blog.
